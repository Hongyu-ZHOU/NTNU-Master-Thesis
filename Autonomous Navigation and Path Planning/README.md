# Autonomous-Path-Planning
Master Thesis, Spring 2020, NTNU

- Used a navigation function/stream function as a guidance model, which would dynamically be updated as the workspace of autonomous vehicles changes, to incorporate dynamic information of the workspace.
- Performed path planning (determine discrete waypoints and directions based on the chosen guidance model).
- Performed path generation to obtain a smooth and short path, by formulating an optimization problem using Bezier curves.
- Implemented a path-following control law (e.g. maneuvering using backstepping or Line-of-Sight).
